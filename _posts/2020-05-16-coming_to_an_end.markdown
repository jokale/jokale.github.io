*Finally made it to the final module!* I thought I was never going to get to this point. I am somewhat sad but also excited to get here. Sad to be finishing but excited to see what is to come and see my skills really be put to work *literally*.

From CLI to React with Redux I must say this every project was challenging but this last one has allowed me to see how my developer mindset is building (***it still has a long way to go but still way more developed than it was in the start!***)

Redux was tricky but as I worked on my project I saw how it made a lot of sense being able to have all your state in one easy accessible place for all your components to have *easy access too*.

I'll be honest coming off Javascript I am still trying to connect the dots between Javascript and React and tying it in with Redux. Despite being on the verge of my project being 100% functional and wanting to run away from Javascript and React. I am hoping with persistence and determination I will go from running away from it to running towards it.
