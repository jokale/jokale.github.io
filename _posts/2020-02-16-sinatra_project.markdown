This project has been the hardest yet. 

I started Sinatra thinking this was soooo easy boy was I wrong! 

Despite I may look back at this and think wow that was so easy in this moment in time it was difficult but it was great to see what I have created and my idea come to life with few several lines of code!

My project was a workout tracker whereby a user could sign up and create several workouts they could come back and look at as well as allowing other users to see their favourite workers then be able to edit their workouts if they wanted to change their workout or completely delete their profile. 

Many up and downs with code not working or even breaking and many moments where I felt like I should just give up but despite it all I pushed forward and although my project may not be the best looking 
Despite my project not looking the best I am very proud of it and I look forward to making it better through some refactoring!
