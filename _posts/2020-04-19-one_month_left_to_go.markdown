Looking back I have learnt so much and time has flown by quickly.
It feels like yesterday I was trying to complete the first mile! 

I have been currently covering Javascript with Rails and it has extremely testing.  Many times I thought I couldn't do this and was ready to give up. Happy to still be here and keep pushing as I am so close to the end!
