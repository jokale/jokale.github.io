I never would have thought I would get to this point here. From the first mile til now I have learned so much and I still can't believe it from CLI project to building a Rails application.

I can't wait to get to the end and really put these skills in motion. It has been amazing to see the growth as a coder and just wanting to learn and build as much as I can. I am constantly trying to understand and dig deep into my code and just learning to be a fearless developer and really taking risks in terms of trying new things by moving code around and just really *testing* my code in comparison to the newbie developer in the first mile who had to play things by the book and needed a helping hand at every step and did not how to search on Google haha (To be fair, I am still learning how to Google problems ).

With this rail project underway I can't wait to see this final project and move onwards and upwards from there!
