Years ago I stumbled across code and absolutely loved it but I never looked at it again despite *it was everywhere and staring at me right in the face.* Fast forward to my 3rd year of university and I thought I loved my degree but I hated it at the same time and I could not fathom working within my degree field.  So during my final year of university I started to do some research on different careers in the tech field *(there are so many lol)*, despite having dabbled in code a few years ago I thought my degree would not give me skills I would need to transition from where I was to anything in the tech field let alone Software Engineering. 

Upon my research I immeadiately fell in love with UX/UI! I felt like it catered to my creative side and allowed me to learn some code ***that was not too difficult*** or a cop out in plain English. However doing more research,  different introudcutory classes in different languages  and speaking to people in the industry I figured out finally that I did indeed have the skills to be a great Software Engineer as well as the passion and drive to achieve this new found goal!

Now I had a part of the formula : **drive + passion + ? =  Full Stack Software Engineer**  but I didn't know what else I needed to make this dream a reality. I scrambled the net over the summer reading countless reviews, endless youtube videos but one school kept popping up.** Flatiron School.** 

Speaking to someone at Flatiron School reassured me that I would be able to go from 0 knowlegde to Software Engineer within the 6 months. I was sold! I applied and fastforward three months later I have just started the course and I am really enjoying it so far!

Onwards and upwards from here!
