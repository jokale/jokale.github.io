Well where to begin, having come off the success of Sinatra and being told about the future successes of Rails, I was excited to get going!

But then came scope methods and rerouting from the outside in and I thought to myself *I thought this was supposed to be easier* haha.

Despite it all I perserved through and tried to asorb as much as could whilst also trying to recognise the differences between Rails and Sinatra. It will still take me some time but I am sure as time goes on I will realise how much easier Rails is.

My web app was called Recipe Reviewer with the sole aim to allow users to be able to create a profile and create recipes and review recipes created by others anonymously!

I really felt that during this project I really took a leap in terms of my skills but also shrugged the feeling of fear of changing something in my code and having to debug and fix issues which I feel will help defintely help  me in the long run. 

I cannot wait to build more applications and even more complex projects in the future.
