My first project. So many words or rather so many commits!

This was very tough to say the least.  For my project I decided to make a CLI program that put out data about the 36 most iconic female athletes of the century. My idea for my project changed every few seconds as a result of the the difficulty of finding a good website to scrape data from which seemed to be one of the hardest parts. Unlike others I worked backwards whereby I tried to build my program without actually having fully read all the criteria a big mistake. After two days of struggling I realised I should read the critera and oh my it was very helpful and helped a lot. As well as pairing with students from my cohort! 

I learnt a lot from this experience and several highs and lows as well lingering imposter syndrome but I am glad its over and I am eager to get feedback to learn about what I need to improve on as I know the journey will be difficult but I am dedicated to being the best coder I can be.
