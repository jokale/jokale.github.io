Before I can delve into how arrays a metaphor for life, I must first describe what an array is. 

In simple english an array is sort of like a list but in special tech language an array 
> is a data structure that contains a group of elements.

Often these elements can contain a variety of data types such as strings or integers. You can mix the data types within an array but more often in an array you'll find one type of data type* e.g* **["hello", "my", "name" "is", "Joanna"]**

Above is an example of what basic arrays look like! Arrays can become more complex and can also be *nested* but that is a whole other ball game for another day!

We use arrays in technology and computer programs to make it easier to organize said data into a set of values which sorted and or searched.

Now onto the important question, how are arrays a metaphor for life?

In my opinion I feel as though arrays signify life in the sense that life (the array or to be exact the square brackets [ ]) and the variety of data types( in this context are life experiences and such alike) mimic life whereby we all go through different life experiences and we can group these into ***sooo many*** catergories from good to bad to regret to love and all these can be different( in the context of data types strings or integers). And just like life Arrays can be changed and you can create or in the conxtent of arrays, shovel in new memories or life experiences into our life array! Our life array can even be nested within other arrays and even data structures just as certain life memories can be shared with others or specific memories triggered by other memories!
