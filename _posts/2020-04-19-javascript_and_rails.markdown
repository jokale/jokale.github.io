Module 4. Javascript and Rails. 

Just when I thought I had overcome the rocky bridge of rails I encountered another bridge only this one had steps missing and lava at the bottom!

Javascript is nothing like I have seen yet (until now of course) but despite the difficulty I managed to see the power of it through my project and many of the other examplar projects.

Wrapping my head around constructors, javascript flow, syntax and allsorts has really been a struggle and I often found myself trying to compare Ruby and Javascript when in reality there are some key differences. 

Nevertheless I am ready to see what React will bring and what the next project will bring.


One big thing I have learnt or that that has been reinforced throughout the modules  is that code can be very unique and it you can give two different people a set challenge and have two different ways of completing the task in question. Feels like there is no right answer with code but sometimes a better answer and I am going to try work towards having the better answer and better code as much as I can!
